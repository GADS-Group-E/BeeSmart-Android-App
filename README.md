To enable each and everyone to learn about the nuances of github, here are a few guidelines. 

- Clone the dev branch and create a new branch with main as the source. 
- Upon completion, create a pull request from your new branch to the main branch.
- This will allow us to perform any checks in the dev branch before we merge with the main branch. 
- Deployment will be performed from the main branch and hence code must not be directly committed to the main branch.
